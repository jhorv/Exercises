BFS was quite difficult to get right in a functional manner. The imperative parts of my brain were fighting me tooth and nail as I was solving this problem - and for good reason. For this thing in particular, the imperative solution using queues and trace arrays would have been far simpler and faster. In F# this problem would have taken me half an hour at most. In Haskell, it took me an entire day.
