# Haskell Exercises

5/21/2016:

Some of the exercises I did in Haskell based on the HackerRank NLP section. The purpose of this is so I can learn how to program Haskell effectively. `Byte The Correct Apple` and `Stitch The Torn Wiki` currently do not give that much points. I tried using cosine similarity for the first, but it did not turn out that well, I haven't gotten even a single point. For comparison a random algorithm got me 6/100. The second did a bit better at 31/100, but it should be possible to get 95% without cheating.

Everyone is cheating on HackerRank though. The leaderboards are completely meaningless.

For the aforementioned ML flavored problems, I am tempted to throw a NN at them and that is in fact what I would do in real life, but this is not something that is an option here, so I'll have to do everything by hand.

I'll take this chance to learn some Bayesian stuff while I am at this. I am really picking up Haskell so I can do some work on Futhark, but it would be good to take a chance to do something more inline with my interests. I did not do well during the PGM course, but maybe learning some probabilistic programming would be more up my alley?
