Let me initialize this repo here. Unlike Haskell, I am already quite proficient at F#, so I won't be doing things like HackerRank exercises. I think in the end with regards to Haskell, I would say that I am quite comfortable with programming in it in a purely functional manner. Hopefully that should be enough for the Futhark compiler. I do not think I would be comfortable doing work in anything more than that.

Lately, having learned Haskell, I have come to feel like learning about [OCaml](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/parisdiderot/56002/session01/Table_of_Contents/) while reading the tome by Diehl in tandem.

After that I'll look into creating GUIs in F#, though I've read that C# might be better for that.

UPDATE: Done with Haskell. In the end, I think it is just a meaningless morass of abstraction. Maybe I am too stupid to understand its deep insights, but I think out of roughly 30 days that I spent learning it, I could have left about 20 out. Insofar I've become a better programmer, that is because I programmed in a purely functional way in a while, not because of all that pointless type theory stuff.

The deeper the abstraction is, the more it needs to be beholden to reality - I think the science types are too eager to forget this sometimes. At that point, science becomes merely superstition.

I do not think learning Haskell past this point will make me a better programmer. The one interesting technique, the lambda-stacking fold is not something I can use in eager languages anyway.

Human-made programming languages might have reached their pinnacle with SML from which F# and OCaml derive. They aren't obsolete anymore than plain arrays and the plus operator is.

I need a break even though it is only 9:15am here.

I think I'll watch the OCaml videos for a bit. I think that might cheer me up. I feel a need to go on a firmer footing.
