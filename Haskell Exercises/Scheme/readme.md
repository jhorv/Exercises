My first foray into Haskell was copy and pasting stuff from [Haskell -> Scheme](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) book. I lost interest near the end when I realized that the book was quite dense for a beginner and left this code before finishing it. I could not focus on it, but it did give me an overview of the language. Unlike the rest of the problems in this repository, the stuff in `scheme.hs` was not written by me.
